(1) coords/
- directory containing coordinates of various subsamples from RESOLVE in batches of 1000 so that they can be read into SDSS D12 Cross ID tool

(2) SDSS_ECO_create.py
- plots emission line diagrams from ECO SDSS data (2a)

(2a) ECO_SDSS_raw.fits and ECO_SDSS_dext.fits
- contains full ECO SDSS flux meausurements (raw and de-extincted, respectively)

(3) SDSS_RESOLVE_create.py
- plots emission line diagrams from RESOVLVE  SDSS data (3a, 3b)

(3a) RESOVE_SDSS_raw.fits and RESOLVE_SDSS_dext.fits
- contains full RESOLVE SDSS flux meausurements (raw and de-extincted, respectively)

(3b) RESOVE_SDSS_dwarf.fits and RESOLVE_SDSS_dext_dwarf.fits
- contains RESOLVE SDSS flux meausurements (raw and de-extincted, respectively) of dwarf galaxies (Mstar < 9.5 solar masses)

(4) SQLquery.txt and SQLquery_ECO.txt
- query used to identify SDSS line flux measurements of interest from various catalogues

(5) resolve_comp.py
- creates various plots attempting to understand the differences between the SDSS line flux measurements and the RESOLVE line flux measurements (merged_bztre.fits) made by Eriks codes
